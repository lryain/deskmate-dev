 * Description: Utility for sampling from the indices [0,N) without replacement.
 *              The results are NOT CONSECUTIVE (check out Vitter JS (1987) for consecutive).
 *              There are 3 related algorithms at work here, based on whether you care if the results are randomly
 *              shuffled.
 *              If you just want a shuffled vector of indices, use CreateFullShuffledVector
