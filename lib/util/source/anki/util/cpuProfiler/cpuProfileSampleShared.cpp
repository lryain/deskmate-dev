 * Description: Data shared between all instances of a single profile (across calls and ticks)
 *              Currently just the name of the sample
 *              Can easily be extended to track stats like min/avg/max time, num calls (per-tick or ever)
 *              but as that can also be collected externally we skip it here for now to minimize skewing performance
