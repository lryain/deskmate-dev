#
# As of cmake 3.9.6, the ninja generator assumes that ".def" files are module definition
# files. If a ".def" file appears as an input file, cmake will generate a (bogus) build rule
# to create it.
#
# Workaround for this behavior is to set source file property HEADER_FILE_ONLY on 
# each ".def" file.  This informs cmake that the file should be treated as a regular 
# header file, not a module definition file.
